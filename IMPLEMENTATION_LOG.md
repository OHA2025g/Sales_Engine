# Implementation Log

## 2026-10-10 (Dograh embed)

- The authenticated shell loads Dograh's official widget script (`#dograh-widget`) with `data-dograh-context` for `page_url` and `today`. Chat embed falls back to the voice embed token. `DOGRAH_WIDGET_ENVIRONMENT` is added to the built widget URL.

## 2026-10-02 (LinkedIn discovery)

- HarvestAPI empty successes now surface the Apify free-plan 10-run limit instead of looking healthy. ICP queries send personas as titles, mapped function IDs, and LinkedIn-friendly locations, and they no longer AND thematic keywords into `searchQuery`.

## 2026-09-30 (Dograh caller)

- `VOICE_CONVERSATION_PROVIDER=dograh` sends a gated dial to the Dograh public agent API. Dograh places the call and receives the published sales script. A missing base, key, or agent UUID is not configured and does not fall through to Exotel or Twilio.

## 2026-09-29 (Content briefs)

- Gemini writes the full post and ad. An optional note can steer the angle. Generation reads drafts already sent for that product and asks for a new angle. Alembic `019` stores the note on the draft.

## 2026-09-28 (Content drafts)

- Content drafts LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram posts plus one ad from the seller profile and a product description. Gemini writes the copy. A missing key stores `NOT_CONFIGURED` and invents nothing. Publish uses the organic publisher or creates a paused ad and does not activate spend. Alembic `018`.

## 2026-09-27 (Meta sandbox)

- `META_ADS_MODE=sandbox` calls the Marketing API and uses `META_SANDBOX_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`. Those ads are not served. Organic posts use `META_POSTING_MODE=live` and the Page token. Ads use `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` only.

## 2026-09-25 (Organic social posts)

- LinkedIn company posts, Facebook Page posts, and Instagram image posts are a separate path from ads. Modes stay `mock` until a post token and page id are set. A live mode without those values records `NOT_CONFIGURED` and does not publish.

## 2026-09-25 (Gemini live adapters)

- Chat, reasoning, embeddings, and uploaded-meeting transcription use Gemini's HTTP API (`generateContent`, `batchEmbedContents`, inline audio). Model ids and the API key come from `GEMINI_*` settings. Missing live credentials stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Example `LLM_PROVIDER` remains `mock`. Re-ingest knowledge after the embedding model changes.

## 2026-09-24 (Mistral live adapters)

- Chat, embeddings, and uploaded-meeting transcription use Mistral's HTTP API. Model ids and the API key come from `MISTRAL_*` settings. Missing live credentials stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Default `LLM_PROVIDER` remains `mock`.

## 2026-09-12 (Full-funnel completion)

- Phase 0: tenant `ProviderAccount` secrets feed ads, voice, and discovery factories. Debug ingest removed. React `error.tsx` added. Voice docs no longer claim there is no dialer.
- Phase 1: `provision_env_credentials` copies deployment secrets into tenant rows. `activate_mode` provisions, then fail-closes. Channels report LIVE from a tenant credential when one exists.
- Phase 2: `VoiceTelephonyProvider` / `VoiceConversationProvider`, Exotel + region router, NDNC/TRAI/recording gates, Vapi + human handoff, versioned voice scripts, Alembic `014`.
- Phase 3: `MeetingCaptureProvider` (Recall, upload STT, manual), consent-gated bot join, transcript-only `meeting_intelligence`, meetings UI, Alembic `015`.
- Phase 4: LinkedIn/Meta ad sets, creatives, ads, activate, consented audience sync, persisted CTR/CPC/CPL, pause/sync UI, Alembic `016`.
- Phase 5: `ContactEnrichmentProvider`, public key-scoped capture + embeddable form, campaign/ad/UTM on Lead/Opportunity, spend-vs-closed-revenue ROI.
- Phase 6: `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `METRICS_TOKEN`, ClamAV, and `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` are set in local `.env` (gitignored). PRODUCTION readiness now fail-closes without encryption, HTTPS callbacks, metrics auth, and malware. `ML_ALLOW_CHAMPION` remains false. Aikido scan requires an Aikido sign-in in this workspace.

## 2026-09-11 (Controlled production pilot batch 8)

- Gap note `docs/52-pilot-readiness-gap-analysis.md`. Runbooks `docs/53`–`docs/57`. ADRs 029–035.
- 8A: Alembic `013` tenant mode, settings versions, WhatsApp consent/templates, outcomes, quality, briefs, overrides, heartbeats. `pilot.view` / `pilot.activate`. Fail-closed activate. Admin Pilot Readiness page. CI RLS fail-if-empty, concurrency job, E2E-LITE + E2E-POSTGRES.
- 8B: `claim_key` / `begin_action` IntegrityError recovery, `FOR UPDATE` on close-won, email in `provider_actions`, Beat heartbeat + `scheduler_unhealthy`, execute-time staleness, AI daily budget fail-closed.
- 8C: Provider precedence, encrypted LinkedIn/Meta/Twilio/Vapi rows, WhatsApp NOT_CONFIGURED path, malware quarantine, mapping unlink + recalc, health rebuild, immutable snapshots + lineage, config export.
- 8D: Close lost / churn / expansion outcomes, data quality, ROI methodology, full traces, daily/weekly briefs, readiness notify without training.
- 8E: Playwright pilot paths, `scripts/pilot_load.py` (measured only), status files distinguish controlled PILOT from unrestricted production.

## 2026-09-11 (Revenue intelligence data foundation batch 7)

- Gap note `docs/45-revenue-intelligence-gap-analysis.md`. Architecture notes `docs/46`–`docs/51`. ADRs 023–028.
- 7A: Alembic `012` extends feature snapshots/labels/model cards; adds prediction tasks, feature sets, label definitions, training examples, datasets, experiments, model versions, predictions, evaluations, drift baselines, opportunity/entity history, recommendation feedback. FORCE RLS. `ml.view|dataset.create|train|promote|rollback`.
- 7B: Deterministic `compute_features` with `as_of`. Opportunity field history on create/patch/close-won. Versioned labels with PENDING/CENSORED. Outcomes use event time.
- 7C: `DatasetBuilder` is tenant-local, fingerprinted, temporally split, rejects leakage and future observations. Readiness gate defaults 200/40/40/90. CLI `python -m app.ml`.
- 7D: `RulesPredictionProvider` is champion. Challengers may write SHADOW predictions only. `ACTIVE` ML rejected. Daily `ml_evaluate_matured`. Training jobs exist and refuse unless ready.
- 7E: `/models` shows readiness, datasets, NO TRAINED MODEL, Challenger: none. No fake accuracy. Autopilot stays on rules.

## 2026-09-11 (Enterprise data + live customer intelligence batch 6)

- Gap note `docs/39-enterprise-data-integration-gap-analysis.md`. Architecture notes `docs/40-customer-signal-architecture.md` through `docs/44-customer-health-v2.md`.
- 6A: Alembic `011` `customer_signals`, `usage_events`, `usage_rollups`, support/finance snapshots, `external_entity_mappings`, watermarks, dirty intelligence, ML feature/outcome tables, FORCE RLS. Inbox routes usage/support/finance/erp away from email. Mapping service: explicit → domain → contract id; fuzzy name stays pending.
- 6B: Generic usage webhook, event-id dedupe, DAU/WAU/MAU rollups, STALE ≠ zero, utilization vs `ContractLine`. High util → upsell rec. Low util → `ADOPTION_RISK`.
- 6C: Generic support/finance/ERP webhooks, upsert/void, `COMMERCIAL_DATA_MISMATCH` task. Vendor stubs stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`.
- 6D: Health `rules-v2` + coverage, same-version trend, dirty-flag Autopilot, risk/renewal/expansion/advocacy evidence, unused NBA generators wired. Feature snapshots and outcome labels collect; no training.
- 6E: Customer 360 freshness cards, Integrations mapping review, Autopilot/Command Center evidence aggregates, Prometheus series without `customer_id` labels, Grafana alert stubs.

## 2026-09-11 (Production hardening batch 5)

- Gap note `docs/35-production-readiness-gap-analysis.md`. Runbooks `docs/36-disaster-recovery.md`, `docs/37-incident-response.md`, checklist `docs/38-production-readiness-checklist.md`.
- 5A: Alembic `009` RLS roles (`agrayian_app` without BYPASSRLS), parameterized `set_config` tenant context, refresh-token families + session APIs, webhook routing tokens (no `X-Tenant-Id`), log redaction, auth rate limits, production seed/demo guards, SecretProvider, `/health/live` + `/health/ready`.
- 5B: Alembic `010` pgvector column + uniqueness, `ObjectStorageProvider` (local/MinIO/S3), knowledge byte persist + download, OpenAPI codegen + drift check, backup/restore scripts.
- 5C: Dead-letter inspect on Autopilot (pagination, attempts, timestamps), `reconcile_requested_actions` for stuck REQUESTED, SSE + 5s polling, emergency/channel kill switches, approval `expires_at`, voice execute re-checks `assert_can_dial`, pagination on activities/runs/approvals/audit/actions, OTel hook, Prometheus HTTP + dead-letter series, Grafana JSON + alerts.
- 5D: Non-root Dockerfiles, Kustomize base + staging/production overlays, migrate Job, CI OpenAPI/RLS/alembic/gitleaks/audit/Bandit/image build. ADRs 014–020.

## 2026-09-11 (Live channel execution batch 4)

- Gap note `docs/34-provider-execution.md`. Alembic `008_live_channels`: ICP filter fields, lead provenance, contact channel/voice consent, campaign external id/metrics, conversation `call_status`, discovery budgets, inbox status/attempts, `provider_actions`, `provider_health_states`.
- Explicit provider modes. Live without credentials is NOT_CONFIGURED. Live HTTP failure never swaps to mock. Mock discovery still returns zero people.
- Discovery: deterministic ICP → harvestapi query builder, validation/provenance, LinkedIn URL / provider_ref / person dedupe, run and candidate budgets on Autopilot and `POST /discovery/run`.
- Ads: pause/status/metrics protocol, budget governance, `ads.launch:{tenant}:{approval_id}` idempotency, persist external id only after confirmation, Celery `sync_ad_campaigns` every 5 minutes, derived CTR/CPC/CPL only when inputs exist.
- Voice: `VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` / `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` / `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `assert_can_dial` uses voice consent + preferred channel, Autopilot queues eligible dials, Twilio/Vapi callbacks, transcript + deterministic outcome routing (DNC / follow-up / nurture / meeting).
- Ops: persist-then-async inbox, failure classes, circuit breaker, dead-letter APIs, ActionDispatcher registry, Prometheus provider counters, Autopilot/Integrations LIVE|MOCK|NOT CONNECTED, no secrets in UI.
- ADR-013: process-level vendor credentials; Google remains the only per-tenant OAuth. External systems are at-least-once; business effects are effectively-once via inbox uniqueness, action keys, and state checks.

## 2026-09-11 (Post-sale revenue autopilot batch 3)

- Alembic `007_post_sale_autopilot`: contracts, handoff packages, onboarding templates, health snapshots, customer risks, usage snapshots, product relationships, expansion recommendations, AI artifacts. Additive Customer/Renewal/milestone/advocacy columns and Autopilot post-sale flags.
- Closed Won activates once per opportunity (`customer.activation:{tenant}:{opportunity}`): owners, Contract from won Quote (unknown term/escalation stay null), HandoffPackage + HandoffAgent, default 8-milestone onboarding, renewal, success plan, rules-v1 health, NBA, handoff task.
- Health v2 is evidence-only. Mock usage and unavailable support/finance are labeled and excluded from the total. Snapshots carry a real trend. `churn-rules-v1` raises risks; CustomerSuccessAgent drafts only.
- Renewal windows 180/120/90/60/30 with no duplicate window events. Baseline comes from the contract and stays `needs_review` when escalation is unknown. RenewalAgent brief + `renewal.commercial` approval.
- Expansion Autopilot refreshes whitespace and catalog adjacency. Recommendation `amount` is null. Opportunity minting is approval-gated and off by default.
- `advocacy-rules-v1` eligibility. Quotes stay null. Referral ingest creates a Lead with `source=referral` and `consent_email=false`.
- Orchestrator routes post-sale events. Celery Beat: frequent 5m, daily 24h, weekly 7d. Cycle step 6 runs frequent + daily. Customer 360, Home attention, Autopilot lanes ACQUIRE/SELL/SUCCEED/RETAIN/GROW/ADVOCATE, Approval categories.
- Pytest journeys 1–7 + cross-tenant 404. Playwright closed-won → customer automation → Autopilot activity → renewal. SSE still deferred.

## 2026-09-06 (Live engagement loop batch 2)

- Alembic `006_live_engagement`: `provider_accounts`, `email_messages`, `provider_inbox_events`, conversation/meeting/settings columns. Fernet helpers for integration tokens.
- Google OAuth connect/callback/disconnect. `GmailEmailProvider` + `GoogleCalendarProvider` with Outlook/Microsoft stubs. Tenant-aware factories. Live mode does not fall back to mock.
- `ActionDispatcher` executes send/calendar/ads/voice. Send gates: consent, pause, quiet hours, daily/contact/gap limits, pending-then-approved, `email.send:{tenant}:{approval_id}`. Enrollment steps advance after send.
- Inbound: Beat history sync, webhook persist-then-process, mock `/inbox/simulate`. ReplyIntelligence + deterministic router. Unsubscribe wins.
- Calendar owner fallback, deterministic slots, book/reschedule/cancel. `lead.status=meeting_scheduled`. Integrations desk + Autopilot health (Gmail / Google Calendar, MOCK not a config block).
- Pytest engagement suite + Playwright journeys 1–5. SSE remains debt.

## 2026-09-05 (Autopilot control plane batch 1)

- Settings, entity automation state, and idempotency keys in Alembic `005_autopilot_control_plane`. Seed writes default settings (`enabled=true`) and syncs `ENABLE_AUTOPILOT`.
- `RevenueOrchestrator` consumes `domain_events`. Lead intake: enrich → score → qualify → research → NBA → enroll or Blocked by policy. `score_lead` emits `lead.scored`. `research_account` no longer commits.
- Reconcile cycle honors settings and skips disabled tenants. Celery Beat: outbox every 1 min, cycles every 15 min. Compose `beat` service.
- Approve `*.send` enrolls if needed, sends via MockEmailProvider, persists activity + provider id, emits `email.sent`. Edit & Approve and entity pause are on the card.
- APIs: settings, status, activity, entity trace, pause/resume/retry. Home, Autopilot console, Approvals evidence, lead/account Automation section. UI polls every 5s.
- Pytest journeys: consented intake, mock send, no-consent block, disabled skip, entity pause. Existing suite 50 passed. Playwright smoke + CI e2e job.

## 2026-08-22 (autonomy Phases 2–5)

- Lead discovery: `LeadDiscoveryProvider` (Apify official API or labeled mock). Persist Lead/Account/Contact with `source=ai_discovery`, email/person dedupe, DNC skip. Human add and CSV import stay (`human` / `import`).
- Autopilot: `autonomous_runs` + steps, `run_autonomous_cycle` (discover → markets → rescore → consent-only send queue → ads Approvals). Desk `/automation/runs`. Celery `run_autonomous_cycles`.
- Ads: `AdsProvider` mock + LinkedIn/Meta adapters. Campaign Launch → `ads.spend` approval. No invented CTR/spend.
- Voice: `VoiceProvider` mock + Twilio/Vapi. Dial requires consent + `voice.dial` approval. Meeting extract uses approved LLM tool and cites/abstains.
- API: 45 pytest passed. Web lint/tsc passed.

## 2026-08-22 (autonomy Phase 1 — UI)

- Contacts list and detail now return `account_name` from a tenant-scoped account join.
- ICP industries and geographies render as wrapping chips.
- API: `tests/test_contacts.py` (2 passed). Web lint/tsc passed.
