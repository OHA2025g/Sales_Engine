# Implementation Log

## 2026-10-27 (Discovery and enrichment follow-through)

- A discovery run now requires one operating plan and one ICP. An explicit id is used when it belongs to the tenant. Otherwise the only open plan, or the single default ICP, is used. Several open plans or several ICPs with no default stop the run and do not call the provider. The filters actually passed are stored on the discovery event. The lead keeps that plan and ICP. People are matched by email, LinkedIn URL, or provider reference. The same name at the same company does not merge two people. Missing email, phone, and firmographics stay missing. Mock or unconfigured research is recorded as incomplete and does not invent a brief.
- Follow-through uses the existing outbox. The person is saved before assessment. A replay does not create a second lead, task, enrollment, or approval. A discovered person is not an inbound enquiry and does not get an acknowledgement. Public contact data and an automation grant do not create consent. Without outbound permission the lead and research stay, a task says what is missing, and no send approval is created. An assessment-eligible, permissioned fixture enrolls the sequence bound to that plan and prepares one draft through the existing generator. Sending stays behind approval. A later research note does not rewrite an approved body. Missing fit stays a gap. Opt-out and a verified not-a-fit stay stops. A numerical score does not override the assessment.
- The lead dossier shows the discovery source, the selected product, the missing fields, enrichment state, channel eligibility, owner, next action, and the draft approval when one exists. The approval card also shows the frozen context version. No new dashboard was added.
- Local integration: Docker was started. A custom-format backup was written to `.local-backups/agrayian-before-037-2026-10-27.dump` while the database was Alembic `036` (9 enrollments, 18 approvals, 43 leads, 901 assessment decisions, 3 held approvals, 9 held enrollments). The compatible code is this uncommitted working tree on commit `35874c9`. That commit alone does not contain these migrations. Restoration: stop api, worker, and beat, then `pg_restore --clean --if-exists` that dump into the `agrayian` database from inside the Postgres container. That returns the schema to `036`. Start the current images only after `alembic upgrade head`, or start the image that was built for `036`.
- Migrations `037` and `038` were applied first to a disposable copy of that backup. Existing rows kept empty context, `outbound_eligible` false, and null `icp_id`. The copy was dropped. The same upgrade was then applied to the local database with worker and beat stopped. The prepared demonstration was still `prepared`, expiry `2026-10-29 18:03:28.181796+00`. Before restart, that scope blocked billable discovery, live publish, send, and ads. Api, web, worker, and beat images were rebuilt. After restart, due publish, the outbox, and stale-hold passed with nothing to release. The existing mailbox poll read Gmail history and stored nothing new. No discovery, publish, send, booking, call, or spend was started.
- Of 28 `ai_discovery` leads, none currently have email consent on the lead or the linked contact, and the audit log has no consent action. Those rows are not permission. The six consented discovery rows named in the earlier plan are not present as consented rows now.
- Fixture evidence is `apps/api/tests/test_discovery_follow.py`, plus the existing discovery ranking test, `tests/test_outbound_sequence.py`, and `tests/test_demo_publish.py`: 10 passed. An isolated approval and lead were opened in the local browser and then deleted. Real approvals were not decided. No Apify, Gmail send, social publish, or live model call was made for the proof.

## 2026-10-27 (Product-aware outbound drafts)

- A sequence draft now resolves one product from the sequence operating plan, the lead operating plan, or a single campaign-plan offer. A missing link asks for a plan. A conflicting link stores no approval. The context is frozen on the enrollment and on the approval, so a later catalogue edit does not change an approved message.
- `draft_email_from_facts` now returns either the model text or a labeled deterministic fallback. The fallback uses the frozen product and known lead facts. It does not keep an unresolved placeholder or invent a discount, a result, or a testimonial. Research is included only for the same tenant and lead or account, with a source, and only for 30 days. Inferences stay labeled as inferences.
- Outbound eligibility is an assessment decision. A low score does not veto it. Consent alone does not grant it. Acknowledgements and sequences stay separate. The approval card shows the product, the draft, the facts, the gaps, and the generation status.
- A DEMO tenant cannot call the LinkedIn or Meta publisher without an applicable authorized scope. Missing, prepared, expired, and wrong-action scopes make no live call. Mock publishing still works. The prepared demonstration was not authorized and its expiry was not changed.
- Fixture evidence is `apps/api/tests/test_outbound_sequence.py` and `apps/api/tests/test_demo_publish.py`. Compatibility runs covered lifecycle enrollment, consented intake, the missing-grant block, assessment, organic acquisition, demo readiness, ads, content, and social posts. No email was sent, no post was published, no meeting was booked, no call was placed, no money was spent, and no discovery was run. Alembic `037` is in the tree and is not applied to the running database until the API image is rebuilt.

## 2026-10-27 (Product-aware organic acquisition)

- A due approved operating-plan creative publishes once through `publish_due_operating_plans` into a mock post. The post link carries a publication token. A consented capture stores that publication, the plan, and the selected product. The same submission does not create a second lead or a second acknowledgement.
- Organic drafts and acknowledgements share one product context. The GOV fixture names Autonomous Revenue OS and INR 300,000 for companies under 200 employees. Another SKU's price is not copied. The acknowledgement includes the price only when the enquiry asks. Sparse firmographics stay eligible for that acknowledgement and do not open an opportunity.
- Billable discovery on a DEMO tenant requires an authorized scope that includes `discovery.search`. A missing or prepared scope does not run it. Paid activation fails closed when the spend limit is zero, missing, invalid, or exhausted. The prepared demonstration was not authorized and its expiry was not changed.
- Fixture evidence is `apps/api/tests/test_organic_acquisition.py`, the spend tests in `apps/api/tests/test_ads.py`, and the existing combined-offer and prepared-acknowledgement tests. No live provider was called for this proof. Alembic `036` is applied on the local database. Creative versions remain drafts. Nothing was published or sent.

## 2026-10-26 (Local demonstration prepared)

- The open operating plan offers Autonomous Revenue OS. The confirmed prices are the one-time ₹3,00,000 line for a company under 200 employees (SKU GOV) and the monthly ₹50,000 starting line for a company of about 50 to 200 employees (SKU CORE). There is no bundle price. The 200 to 1,000 employee product remains stored and is not this offer.
- Creative version 3 is the bound draft. It is not authorized and not published. The capture link is the local Interest form, so public publishing stays blocked.
- Google mailbox identity, inbox reading, calendar identity, and free/busy checks succeeded for the connected Gmail account. Nothing was sent and no event was created. LinkedIn organization 143930363 still returns 403 for the organization and publishing-permission reads. A stored token was not treated as verification.
- The demonstration scope is prepared, not authorized. It allows one acknowledgement, one meeting-options email, and one calendar booking. The acknowledgement grant covers only that acknowledgement. Sequence outreach, ads, voice, and LinkedIn publishing stay outside it. Historical holds were not released.
- Gmail inbound remains polling. Public hosting stays postponed. Object storage is not running. Administration stays authenticated. The local database is at Alembic 035.
- A later public host needs the compose ports and environment, the Postgres volume, the Google redirect and CORS origins, the web app origin, and a verified LinkedIn publishing permission. https://agrayianailabs.com is a separate marketing site.

## 2026-10-23 (Controlled demonstration readiness)

- Alembic `034` adds the demonstration scope, the operating-plan offer snapshot, and inbound mail headers. Migrations `032` and `033` were not edited.
- Stale external work is held for review. Records and audit history stay. A prepared demonstration scope blocks every external send until it is authorized.
- Automated replies and bounces do not receive a sales response. Out-of-office still defers. Two automated responders stop after the bounded limit.
- Worker health reads the worker heartbeat. Beat health reads scheduler activity. An operating plan keeps the product selected at start.
- The compose application is on revision `034`. No post was published, no message was sent, and no calendar event was created.

## 2026-10-21 (Website signals)

- Strategy → Website signals confirms a catalog of public website facts, reads account sites for free, and counts a cohort. The opening line repeats one observed fact. Existing discovery, sequences, and sending are unchanged. Alembic `031`.

## 2026-10-10 (Channel search uses Apify)

- Channel search is back on Apify while the Gemini free-tier daily quota is used up. `CHANNEL_SEARCH_PROVIDER=apify`.

## 2026-10-10 (Social extra links)

- A social post can keep its form as the main link and also carry other links, such as a website. Those addresses are written into the post text. Alembic `027`.

## 2026-10-10 (Channel search uses Gemini)

- Channel search uses the configured Gemini model and Google Search. `CHANNEL_SEARCH_PROVIDER=gemini`.

## 2026-10-10 (Edit a social post)

- Social posts can be edited from the site. A post that never went out can change its text, form, and image, and is sent again. A live Facebook or LinkedIn post can change its caption. A live Instagram post cannot be changed by the app, so the edit publishes a new post and leaves the live one as it is.

## 2026-10-10 (Channel search relevance)

- Channel search drops a result when its title and text do not match the keyword. An empty channel says that no public posts matched. Rank stays the Google position of the results that remain.

## 2026-10-10 (Channel search)

- Marketing → Channel search ranks up to 10 public results for a keyword on Google, Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Rank is the Google result position. A missing Programmable Search key, Apify token, or Gemini model stores `not_configured` and invents no posts. Alembic `024`.

## 2026-10-10 (Instagram form caption and image upload)

- Instagram feed posts cannot embed a form on the photo. A selected form is written at the top of the caption so people can open it. A post can use a pasted image URL or an uploaded JPEG or PNG. Alembic `026`.

## 2026-10-10 (Social form attach)

- Named public forms can be created for different purposes. A social post selects one, and the server attaches that form's website link with social attribution. Visitors open the form and submit it as inbound interest. Alembic `023` stores the form on the post. Alembic `025` lets that public link resolve the form without a signed-in session.

## 2026-10-10 (Published post link)

- Content and Social show a View post link for published LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram posts. The URL comes from the network permalink or the stored post id. The company website is not used as the post.

## 2026-10-10 (Dograh embed)

- The authenticated shell loads Dograh's official widget script (`#dograh-widget`) with `data-dograh-context` for `page_url` and `today`. Chat embed falls back to the voice embed token. `DOGRAH_WIDGET_ENVIRONMENT` is added to the built widget URL.

## 2026-10-02 (LinkedIn discovery)

- HarvestAPI empty successes now surface the Apify free-plan 10-run limit instead of looking healthy. ICP queries send personas as titles, mapped function IDs, and LinkedIn-friendly locations, and they no longer AND thematic keywords into `searchQuery`.

## 2026-09-30 (Dograh caller)

- `VOICE_CONVERSATION_PROVIDER=dograh` sends a gated dial to the Dograh public agent API. Dograh places the call and receives the published sales script. A missing base, key, or agent UUID is not configured and does not fall through to Exotel or Twilio.

## 2026-09-29 (Content briefs)

- Gemini writes the full post and ad. An optional note can steer the angle. Generation reads drafts already sent for that product and asks for a new angle. Alembic `019` stores the note on the draft.

## 2026-09-28 (Content drafts)

- Content drafts LinkedIn, Facebook, and Instagram posts plus one ad from the seller profile and a product description. Gemini writes the copy. A missing key stores `NOT_CONFIGURED` and invents nothing. Publish uses the organic publisher or creates a paused ad and does not activate spend. Alembic `018`.

## 2026-09-27 (Meta sandbox)

- `META_ADS_MODE=sandbox` calls the Marketing API and uses `META_SANDBOX_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`. Those ads are not served. Organic posts use `META_POSTING_MODE=live` and the Page token. Ads use `META_ACCESS_TOKEN` only.

## 2026-09-25 (Organic social posts)

- LinkedIn company posts, Facebook Page posts, and Instagram image posts are a separate path from ads. Modes stay `mock` until a post token and page id are set. A live mode without those values records `NOT_CONFIGURED` and does not publish.

## 2026-09-25 (Gemini live adapters)

- Chat, reasoning, embeddings, and uploaded-meeting transcription use Gemini's HTTP API (`generateContent`, `batchEmbedContents`, inline audio). Model ids and the API key come from `GEMINI_*` settings. Missing live credentials stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Example `LLM_PROVIDER` remains `mock`. Re-ingest knowledge after the embedding model changes.

## 2026-09-24 (Mistral live adapters)

- Chat, embeddings, and uploaded-meeting transcription use Mistral's HTTP API. Model ids and the API key come from `MISTRAL_*` settings. Missing live credentials stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`. Default `LLM_PROVIDER` remains `mock`.

## 2026-09-12 (Full-funnel completion)

- Phase 0: tenant `ProviderAccount` secrets feed ads, voice, and discovery factories. Debug ingest removed. React `error.tsx` added. Voice docs no longer claim there is no dialer.
- Phase 1: `provision_env_credentials` copies deployment secrets into tenant rows. `activate_mode` provisions, then fail-closes. Channels report LIVE from a tenant credential when one exists.
- Phase 2: `VoiceTelephonyProvider` / `VoiceConversationProvider`, Exotel + region router, NDNC/TRAI/recording gates, Vapi + human handoff, versioned voice scripts, Alembic `014`.
- Phase 3: `MeetingCaptureProvider` (Recall, upload STT, manual), consent-gated bot join, transcript-only `meeting_intelligence`, meetings UI, Alembic `015`.
- Phase 4: LinkedIn/Meta ad sets, creatives, ads, activate, consented audience sync, persisted CTR/CPC/CPL, pause/sync UI, Alembic `016`.
- Phase 5: `ContactEnrichmentProvider`, public key-scoped capture + embeddable form, campaign/ad/UTM on Lead/Opportunity, spend-vs-closed-revenue ROI.
- Phase 6: `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `METRICS_TOKEN`, ClamAV, and `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` are set in local `.env` (gitignored). PRODUCTION readiness now fail-closes without encryption, HTTPS callbacks, metrics auth, and malware. `ML_ALLOW_CHAMPION` remains false. Aikido scan requires an Aikido sign-in in this workspace.

## 2026-09-11 (Controlled production pilot batch 8)

- Gap note `docs/52-pilot-readiness-gap-analysis.md`. Runbooks `docs/53`–`docs/57`. ADRs 029–035.
- 8A: Alembic `013` tenant mode, settings versions, WhatsApp consent/templates, outcomes, quality, briefs, overrides, heartbeats. `pilot.view` / `pilot.activate`. Fail-closed activate. Admin Pilot Readiness page. CI RLS fail-if-empty, concurrency job, E2E-LITE + E2E-POSTGRES.
- 8B: `claim_key` / `begin_action` IntegrityError recovery, `FOR UPDATE` on close-won, email in `provider_actions`, Beat heartbeat + `scheduler_unhealthy`, execute-time staleness, AI daily budget fail-closed.
- 8C: Provider precedence, encrypted LinkedIn/Meta/Twilio/Vapi rows, WhatsApp NOT_CONFIGURED path, malware quarantine, mapping unlink + recalc, health rebuild, immutable snapshots + lineage, config export.
- 8D: Close lost / churn / expansion outcomes, data quality, ROI methodology, full traces, daily/weekly briefs, readiness notify without training.
- 8E: Playwright pilot paths, `scripts/pilot_load.py` (measured only), status files distinguish controlled PILOT from unrestricted production.

## 2026-09-11 (Revenue intelligence data foundation batch 7)

- Gap note `docs/45-revenue-intelligence-gap-analysis.md`. Architecture notes `docs/46`–`docs/51`. ADRs 023–028.
- 7A: Alembic `012` extends feature snapshots/labels/model cards; adds prediction tasks, feature sets, label definitions, training examples, datasets, experiments, model versions, predictions, evaluations, drift baselines, opportunity/entity history, recommendation feedback. FORCE RLS. `ml.view|dataset.create|train|promote|rollback`.
- 7B: Deterministic `compute_features` with `as_of`. Opportunity field history on create/patch/close-won. Versioned labels with PENDING/CENSORED. Outcomes use event time.
- 7C: `DatasetBuilder` is tenant-local, fingerprinted, temporally split, rejects leakage and future observations. Readiness gate defaults 200/40/40/90. CLI `python -m app.ml`.
- 7D: `RulesPredictionProvider` is champion. Challengers may write SHADOW predictions only. `ACTIVE` ML rejected. Daily `ml_evaluate_matured`. Training jobs exist and refuse unless ready.
- 7E: `/models` shows readiness, datasets, NO TRAINED MODEL, Challenger: none. No fake accuracy. Autopilot stays on rules.

## 2026-09-11 (Enterprise data + live customer intelligence batch 6)

- Gap note `docs/39-enterprise-data-integration-gap-analysis.md`. Architecture notes `docs/40-customer-signal-architecture.md` through `docs/44-customer-health-v2.md`.
- 6A: Alembic `011` `customer_signals`, `usage_events`, `usage_rollups`, support/finance snapshots, `external_entity_mappings`, watermarks, dirty intelligence, ML feature/outcome tables, FORCE RLS. Inbox routes usage/support/finance/erp away from email. Mapping service: explicit → domain → contract id; fuzzy name stays pending.
- 6B: Generic usage webhook, event-id dedupe, DAU/WAU/MAU rollups, STALE ≠ zero, utilization vs `ContractLine`. High util → upsell rec. Low util → `ADOPTION_RISK`.
- 6C: Generic support/finance/ERP webhooks, upsert/void, `COMMERCIAL_DATA_MISMATCH` task. Vendor stubs stay `NOT_CONFIGURED`.
- 6D: Health `rules-v2` + coverage, same-version trend, dirty-flag Autopilot, risk/renewal/expansion/advocacy evidence, unused NBA generators wired. Feature snapshots and outcome labels collect; no training.
- 6E: Customer 360 freshness cards, Integrations mapping review, Autopilot/Command Center evidence aggregates, Prometheus series without `customer_id` labels, Grafana alert stubs.

## 2026-09-11 (Production hardening batch 5)

- Gap note `docs/35-production-readiness-gap-analysis.md`. Runbooks `docs/36-disaster-recovery.md`, `docs/37-incident-response.md`, checklist `docs/38-production-readiness-checklist.md`.
- 5A: Alembic `009` RLS roles (`agrayian_app` without BYPASSRLS), parameterized `set_config` tenant context, refresh-token families + session APIs, webhook routing tokens (no `X-Tenant-Id`), log redaction, auth rate limits, production seed/demo guards, SecretProvider, `/health/live` + `/health/ready`.
- 5B: Alembic `010` pgvector column + uniqueness, `ObjectStorageProvider` (local/MinIO/S3), knowledge byte persist + download, OpenAPI codegen + drift check, backup/restore scripts.
- 5C: Dead-letter inspect on Autopilot (pagination, attempts, timestamps), `reconcile_requested_actions` for stuck REQUESTED, SSE + 5s polling, emergency/channel kill switches, approval `expires_at`, voice execute re-checks `assert_can_dial`, pagination on activities/runs/approvals/audit/actions, OTel hook, Prometheus HTTP + dead-letter series, Grafana JSON + alerts.
- 5D: Non-root Dockerfiles, Kustomize base + staging/production overlays, migrate Job, CI OpenAPI/RLS/alembic/gitleaks/audit/Bandit/image build. ADRs 014–020.

## 2026-09-11 (Live channel execution batch 4)

- Gap note `docs/34-provider-execution.md`. Alembic `008_live_channels`: ICP filter fields, lead provenance, contact channel/voice consent, campaign external id/metrics, conversation `call_status`, discovery budgets, inbox status/attempts, `provider_actions`, `provider_health_states`.
- Explicit provider modes. Live without credentials is NOT_CONFIGURED. Live HTTP failure never swaps to mock. Mock discovery still returns zero people.
- Discovery: deterministic ICP → harvestapi query builder, validation/provenance, LinkedIn URL / provider_ref / person dedupe, run and candidate budgets on Autopilot and `POST /discovery/run`.
- Ads: pause/status/metrics protocol, budget governance, `ads.launch:{tenant}:{approval_id}` idempotency, persist external id only after confirmation, Celery `sync_ad_campaigns` every 5 minutes, derived CTR/CPC/CPL only when inputs exist.
- Voice: `VAPI_ASSISTANT_ID` / `VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` / `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `assert_can_dial` uses voice consent + preferred channel, Autopilot queues eligible dials, Twilio/Vapi callbacks, transcript + deterministic outcome routing (DNC / follow-up / nurture / meeting).
- Ops: persist-then-async inbox, failure classes, circuit breaker, dead-letter APIs, ActionDispatcher registry, Prometheus provider counters, Autopilot/Integrations LIVE|MOCK|NOT CONNECTED, no secrets in UI.
- ADR-013: process-level vendor credentials; Google remains the only per-tenant OAuth. External systems are at-least-once; business effects are effectively-once via inbox uniqueness, action keys, and state checks.

## 2026-09-11 (Post-sale revenue autopilot batch 3)

- Alembic `007_post_sale_autopilot`: contracts, handoff packages, onboarding templates, health snapshots, customer risks, usage snapshots, product relationships, expansion recommendations, AI artifacts. Additive Customer/Renewal/milestone/advocacy columns and Autopilot post-sale flags.
- Closed Won activates once per opportunity (`customer.activation:{tenant}:{opportunity}`): owners, Contract from won Quote (unknown term/escalation stay null), HandoffPackage + HandoffAgent, default 8-milestone onboarding, renewal, success plan, rules-v1 health, NBA, handoff task.
- Health v2 is evidence-only. Mock usage and unavailable support/finance are labeled and excluded from the total. Snapshots carry a real trend. `churn-rules-v1` raises risks; CustomerSuccessAgent drafts only.
- Renewal windows 180/120/90/60/30 with no duplicate window events. Baseline comes from the contract and stays `needs_review` when escalation is unknown. RenewalAgent brief + `renewal.commercial` approval.
- Expansion Autopilot refreshes whitespace and catalog adjacency. Recommendation `amount` is null. Opportunity minting is approval-gated and off by default.
- `advocacy-rules-v1` eligibility. Quotes stay null. Referral ingest creates a Lead with `source=referral` and `consent_email=false`.
- Orchestrator routes post-sale events. Celery Beat: frequent 5m, daily 24h, weekly 7d. Cycle step 6 runs frequent + daily. Customer 360, Home attention, Autopilot lanes ACQUIRE/SELL/SUCCEED/RETAIN/GROW/ADVOCATE, Approval categories.
- Pytest journeys 1–7 + cross-tenant 404. Playwright closed-won → customer automation → Autopilot activity → renewal. SSE still deferred.

## 2026-09-06 (Live engagement loop batch 2)

- Alembic `006_live_engagement`: `provider_accounts`, `email_messages`, `provider_inbox_events`, conversation/meeting/settings columns. Fernet helpers for integration tokens.
- Google OAuth connect/callback/disconnect. `GmailEmailProvider` + `GoogleCalendarProvider` with Outlook/Microsoft stubs. Tenant-aware factories. Live mode does not fall back to mock.
- `ActionDispatcher` executes send/calendar/ads/voice. Send gates: consent, pause, quiet hours, daily/contact/gap limits, pending-then-approved, `email.send:{tenant}:{approval_id}`. Enrollment steps advance after send.
- Inbound: Beat history sync, webhook persist-then-process, mock `/inbox/simulate`. ReplyIntelligence + deterministic router. Unsubscribe wins.
- Calendar owner fallback, deterministic slots, book/reschedule/cancel. `lead.status=meeting_scheduled`. Integrations desk + Autopilot health (Gmail / Google Calendar, MOCK not a config block).
- Pytest engagement suite + Playwright journeys 1–5. SSE remains debt.

## 2026-09-05 (Autopilot control plane batch 1)

- Settings, entity automation state, and idempotency keys in Alembic `005_autopilot_control_plane`. Seed writes default settings (`enabled=true`) and syncs `ENABLE_AUTOPILOT`.
- `RevenueOrchestrator` consumes `domain_events`. Lead intake: enrich → score → qualify → research → NBA → enroll or Blocked by policy. `score_lead` emits `lead.scored`. `research_account` no longer commits.
- Reconcile cycle honors settings and skips disabled tenants. Celery Beat: outbox every 1 min, cycles every 15 min. Compose `beat` service.
- Approve `*.send` enrolls if needed, sends via MockEmailProvider, persists activity + provider id, emits `email.sent`. Edit & Approve and entity pause are on the card.
- APIs: settings, status, activity, entity trace, pause/resume/retry. Home, Autopilot console, Approvals evidence, lead/account Automation section. UI polls every 5s.
- Pytest journeys: consented intake, mock send, no-consent block, disabled skip, entity pause. Existing suite 50 passed. Playwright smoke + CI e2e job.

## 2026-08-22 (autonomy Phases 2–5)

- Lead discovery: `LeadDiscoveryProvider` (Apify official API or labeled mock). Persist Lead/Account/Contact with `source=ai_discovery`, email/person dedupe, DNC skip. Human add and CSV import stay (`human` / `import`).
- Autopilot: `autonomous_runs` + steps, `run_autonomous_cycle` (discover → markets → rescore → consent-only send queue → ads Approvals). Desk `/automation/runs`. Celery `run_autonomous_cycles`.
- Ads: `AdsProvider` mock + LinkedIn/Meta adapters. Campaign Launch → `ads.spend` approval. No invented CTR/spend.
- Voice: `VoiceProvider` mock + Twilio/Vapi. Dial requires consent + `voice.dial` approval. Meeting extract uses approved LLM tool and cites/abstains.
- API: 45 pytest passed. Web lint/tsc passed.

## 2026-08-22 (autonomy Phase 1 — UI)

- Contacts list and detail now return `account_name` from a tenant-scoped account join.
- ICP industries and geographies render as wrapping chips.
- API: `tests/test_contacts.py` (2 passed). Web lint/tsc passed.

## 2026-08-18

## 2026-08-18 (gap-fill + desk)

- Closed Phase 0–6 product gaps: PATCH for contacts/leads/ICPs, task search, account 360, global search, CSV import, command-center overview, meeting prep.
- Rebuilt the web desk to an industry command plane: Manrope/Newsreader, gold/ivory graphite, command palette, copilot drawer, kanban pipeline, create/edit drawers, search/filter/pagination.
- Added ICP, customers, import, teams, contact/task detail, and designed-empty later-engine pages.
- Validation: API 16 passed + ruff; web lint/tsc/vitest 4 passed/next build passed.

## 2026-08-19 (Phases 7–8)

- Phase 7 Market Intelligence: markets, five signal types, triggers, rules-v1 scoring, mock company/intent/news/tech providers, refresh + research tools.
- Phase 8 Acquisition: inbound capture with UTM/consent, opt-out refusal, email and fuzzy-name dedupe review. Sequences and paid ads remain later.
- UI: `/market`, `/market/signals`, `/market/triggers`, `/acquisition`. Success stays coming-soon.
- Validation: API 21 passed + ruff.

## 2026-08-19 (Phases 9–22)
