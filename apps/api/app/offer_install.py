AGRAYIAN Autonomous Revenue OS is the product. It is one workspace for a company's revenue, from finding the right accounts through renewal and referral.

The lifecycle is Intelligence, Acquire, Sell, Close, Succeed, Retain, Expand, Advocate, and Learn. Intelligence chooses who to sell to. Acquire finds companies and captures inbound interest. Sell prepares conversations and meetings. Close turns a qualified deal into a quote and a contract. Succeed onboards the customer. Retain watches renewal. Expand recommends more only when usage evidence exists. Advocate asks for a referral only after value is confirmed. Learn writes the outcome back into the next cycle.

Autopilot prepares discovery, enrichment, scoring, research, and message drafts. A person approves every send, every ad spend, and every phone dial. Prices, discounts, taxes, scores, and dates are calculated by the system. The model explains them. It does not invent them.

Who it is for: a B2B company in India with about 50 to 1,000 employees and a sales team that already sells to other businesses. The buyer is the founder, chief executive, chief revenue officer, VP of sales, or head of revenue operations. They feel the pain of a CRM that stores names while outreach, content, meetings, quotes, and renewals live somewhere else.

Who it is not for: a company with no sales motion, a consumer brand, or a buyer who wants a chatbot with no record of consent, approval, or audit.

What the buyer gets: the workspace they can sign in to, an ideal customer profile, campaigns and sequences that stay draft until approved, a decision inbox, a pipeline, quotes with list prices, and the post-sale record after a deal is actually won.

Commercial list prices in INR, before tax. One-time setup is 300000 for a company under 200 employees and 400000 for a company of 200 to 1000 employees. The monthly fee starts at 50000 and is raised on the quote as the company gets larger. These are list prices. A quote is created only for a real opportunity.

Nothing on this page is a customer until a real company is discovered, captured with consent, or entered by the team. Example domains and invented bank, hospital, and factory names are not customers.
